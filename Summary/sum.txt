Dognition is a dog training application that offers a subscription-based product to dog owners to help in training their
dogs with different tests at various levels. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify any possible source that
increases the number of Dognition tests completed.

Group 2: DataXperts will use the tools jupyter notebook and Python language to identify correlated sources that can
increase completed dognition tests. 
We will analyze and communicate our team's findings regarding the questions provided for the Dognition data set.
